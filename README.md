## Extensions

### payouts-substitutor

This extension allows the redirection of delegation rewards due to smart contracts (address "KT") of the "oven" type to the owner accounts of the respective contracts.

This extension contributes to the solution proposed by [TezCapital](https://github.com/tez-capital) to the balance management issue of these contracts, which results in a zero reward from the protocol while there is actually delegation (see the complete description [here on Tezos Agora](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/tez-capital-resolving-kt-delegator-payment-issues-in-paris/6256/1)).

#### Installation

- Download the executable appropriate for your operating system and hardware from the [latest release page](https://github.com/LaBoulange/tezpay-extensions/releases/latest).
- Move the downloaded file to the directory from which you intend to run it, typically the same location as `tezpay`.
- If not already done at download or move time, rename it to `payouts-substitutor`.
- Make sure it is executable by the user that runs `tezpay`.

#### Configuration

Add the following element to the list of extensions defined in `tezpay`'s `config.hjson` file:

    extensions: [
        {
            name: payouts-substitutor
            command: /path/to/payouts-substitutor
            args: [
            ]
            kind: stdio
            configuration: {
                LOG_FILE: /path/to/log
                LOG_LEVEL: contracts
                RPC_NODE: https://eu.rpc.tez.capital
            }
            hooks: [
                {
                    id: after_candidates_generated
                    mode: rw
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

**Note**: the `extensions: [ ... ]` array should only be included if no extensions have previously been configured in `config.hjson`. If other extensions are already listed, only the inner block `{ ... }` should be added.    

Configure the following fields of the element above:
- **`command`**: `/path/to/` should be replaced by the path to the directory where you placed the `payouts-substitutor` extension.
- **`LOG_FILE`**: `/path/to/log` should be replaced by the path of the log file the extension should produce. The directory should exist, the extension will only create the file. *(optional: if omitted, no log file will be produced)*.
- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: verbosity of the produced log. *(optional: if omitted, the defult value is 'contracts')*. Allowed values are:
    - *errors*: logs only errors and warnings.
    - *redirects*: everything from *errors* + logs about redirections of rewards to substituted smart contract owner addresses.
    - *contracts*: everything from *redirects* + information related to all other smart contracts.
    - *verbose*: everything from *contracts* + information related to non-smart-contract addresses.
    - *debug*: everything from *verbose* + technical information.
- **`RPC_NODE`**: URL of the RPC node used to query the contracts *(optional: if omitted, the default URL is `https://eu.rpc.tez.capital`)*.

Restart `tezpay` if it is running in `continual` mode. 

You can ensure the extension is working properly by running `tezpay -c <previous cycle number> generate-payouts`.
